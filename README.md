# DCF Model with Monte Carlo Simulations

This project implements a robust Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model, enhanced with Monte Carlo simulations for risk analysis, sensitivity analysis, and scenario planning.

## Features
- Calculate DCF-based valuations.
- Perform Monte Carlo simulations to assess uncertainties.
- Analyze sensitivity and scenarios for cash flows and discount rates.
- Visualize key metrics and insights.

## Installation
