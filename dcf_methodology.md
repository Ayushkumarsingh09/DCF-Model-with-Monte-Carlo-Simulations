# DCF Methodology

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a financial valuation method used to determine the value of an investment based on its future cash flows.

## Key Components
1. **Cash Flows**: Projected net cash inflows from the investment.
2. **Discount Rate**: Rate of return used to discount future cash flows to their present value. Often based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
3. **Terminal Value**: Estimated value of the investment beyond the forecast period.

## Formula
The DCF formula is:
\[
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \(CF_t\): Cash flow at time \(t\)
- \(r\): Discount rate
- \(TV\): Terminal value
