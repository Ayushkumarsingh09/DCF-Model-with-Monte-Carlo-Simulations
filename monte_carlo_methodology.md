# Monte Carlo Methodology

Monte Carlo simulations are used to model uncertainties in financial projections by simulating a range of possible outcomes based on input distributions.

## Steps
1. Define input variables and their probability distributions.
2. Generate a large number of random samples for these variables.
3. Perform the DCF calculation for each sample.
4. Analyze the distribution of the results to understand the range of possible valuations.

## Applications
- Assessing risks in valuation.
- Identifying the probability of achieving specific financial goals.
- Comparing optimistic, pessimistic, and base-case scenarios.
